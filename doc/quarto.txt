Quarto-nvim provides tools for working on quarto <https://quarto.org/>
manuscripts in Neovim. You can get started with Quarto here
<https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>


WALKTHROUGH                                   *quarto-quarto-nvim-walkthrough*

The get started section <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/neovim.html>
also comes with a video version to walk you through. The playlist is extened as
more features are added, so join us for a "Coffee with Quarto and Neovim"

SETUP                                               *quarto-quarto-nvim-setup*

Youcan install `quarto-nvim` from GitHub with your favourite Neovim plugin
manager like lazy.nvim <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>, packer.nvim
<https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim> or VimPlug
<https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug>.

Because Quarto provides a lot of functionality through integration with
existing plugins, some of those have to be told about the existence of
`quarto-nvim` (like e.g. registering it as a source for the autocompletion
plugin `nvim-cmp`).

As such, we recommend you to experiment with the quarto-nvim kickstarter
configuration <https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter> and then pick
the relevant parts from the `lua/plugins/quarto.lua`
<https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter/blob/main/lua/plugins/quarto.lua>
file to integrate it into your own existing configuration.

Plugins and their configuration to look out for in this file are:

>lua
    {
        'quarto-dev/quarto-nvim',
        'jmbuhr/otter.nvim',
        'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp',
        'neovim/nvim-lspconfig',
        'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter'
    }
<

Quarto-nvim requires Neovim >= **v0.9.0**
(<https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable>). If you are unable to
update Neovim, you can specify a specific version of the plugins involved
instead of the latest stable version. How you do this will vary depending on
your plugin manager, but you can see one example using `lazy.nvim` here:
<https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter/blob/nvim-0.8.3/lua/plugins/quarto.lua>

The `version = ...` lines to look out for are for the following plugins:

>lua
    {
        'quarto-dev/quarto-nvim',
        'jmbuhr/otter.nvim',
        'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter'
    }
<


USAGE                                               *quarto-quarto-nvim-usage*


CONFIGURE ~

You can pass a lua table with options to the setup function as shown in
quarto-nvim-kickstarter/..quarto.lua
<https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter/blob/main/lua/plugins/quarto.lua>

It will be merged with the default options, which are shown below in the
example. If you want to use the defaults, simply call `setup` without arguments
or with an empty table.

>lua
    require'quarto'.setup{
      debug = false,
      closePreviewOnExit = true,
      lspFeatures = {
        enabled = true,
        languages = { 'r', 'python', 'julia', 'bash' },
        chunks = 'curly', -- 'curly' or 'all'
        diagnostics = {
          enabled = true,
          triggers = { "BufWritePost" }
        },
        completion = {
          enabled = true,
        },
      },
      keymap = {
        hover = 'K',
        definition = 'gd'
      }
    }
<


PREVIEW ~

Use the command

>vim
    QuartoPreview
<

or access the function from lua, e.g. to create a keybinding:

>lua
    local quarto = require'quarto'
    vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>qp', quarto.quartoPreview, {silent = true, noremap = true})
<

Then use the keyboard shortcut to open `quarto preview` for the current file or
project in the active working directory in the neovim integrated terminal in a
new tab.


LANGUAGE SUPPORT                         *quarto-quarto-nvim-language-support*


DEMO ~


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17450586/209436101-4dd560f4-c876-4dbc-a0f4-b3a2cbff0748.mp4


USAGE ~

Enable quarto-nvim’s lsp features by configuring it with

>lua
    require'quarto'.setup{
      lspFeatures = {
        enabled = true,
      }
    }
<

After enabling the language features, you can open the hover documentation for
R, python and julia code chunks with `K` (or configure a different shortcut).


AUTOCOMPLETION ~

`quarto-nvim` now comes with a completion source for nvim-cmp
<https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp> to deliver swift autocompletion for code
in quarto code chunks. With the quarto language features enabled, you can add
the source in your `cmp` configuration:

>lua
    -- ...
      sources = {
        { name = 'otter' },
      }
    -- ...
<


R DIAGNOSTICS CONFIGURATION ~

To make diagnostics work with R you have to configure the linter a bit, since
the language buffers in the background separate code with blank links, which we
want to ignore. Otherwise you get a lot more diagnostics than you probably
want. Add file `.lintr` to your home folder and fill it with:

>
    linters: linters_with_defaults(
        trailing_blank_lines_linter = NULL,
        trailing_whitespace_linter = NULL
      )
<

You can now also enable other lsp features, such as the show hover function and
shortcut, independent of showing diagnostics by enabling lsp features but not
enabling diagnostics.


OTHER EDGECASES ~

Other languages might have similar issues (e.g. I see a lot of warnings about
whitespace when activating diagnostics with `lua`). If you come across them and
have a fix, I will be very happy about a pull request! Or, what might
ultimately be the cleaner way of documenting language specific issues, an entry
in the wiki <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-nvim/wiki>.


AVAILABLE COMMNDS                       *quarto-quarto-nvim-available-commnds*

RECOMMENDED PLUGINS                   *quarto-quarto-nvim-recommended-plugins*

Quarto works great with a number of existing plugins in the neovim ecosystem.
You can find semi-opinionated but still minimal configurations for `nvim` and
`tmux`, for use with Quarto, R and python in these two repositories:


- <https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter>
- <https://github.com/jmbuhr/tmux-kickstarter>
