Quarto-nvim provides tools for working on Quarto <https://quarto.org/>
manuscripts in Neovim. You can get started with Quarto here
<https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>.


WALKTHROUGH                                   *quarto-quarto-nvim-walkthrough*

The get started section <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/neovim.html>
also comes with a video version to walk you through. The playlist is extened as
more features are added, so join us for a "Coffee with Quarto and Neovim"

<https://youtu.be/3sj7clNowlA?list=PLabWm-zCaD1axcMGvf7wFxJz8FZmyHSJ7>


SETUP                                               *quarto-quarto-nvim-setup*

Youcan install `quarto-nvim` from GitHub with your favourite Neovim plugin
manager like lazy.nvim <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>, packer.nvim
<https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim> or VimPlug
<https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug>.

Example `lazy.nvim` plugin specification:

>lua
    -- plugins/quarto.lua
    return {
      {
        "quarto-dev/quarto-nvim",
        dependencies = {
          "jmbuhr/otter.nvim",
          "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
        },
      },
    }
<

Because Quarto provides a lot of functionality through integration with
existing plugins, we recommend to experiment with the quarto-nvim kickstarter
configuration <https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter> and then pick
the relevant parts from the `lua/plugins/quarto.lua`
<https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter/blob/main/lua/plugins/quarto.lua>
file to integrate it into your own existing configuration.

Plugins and their configuration to look out for in either of those files are:

>lua
    {
        'quarto-dev/quarto-nvim',
        'jmbuhr/otter.nvim',
        'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp',
        'neovim/nvim-lspconfig',
        'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter'
    }
<

Quarto-nvim requires Neovim >= **v0.9.0**
(<https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable>). If you are unable to
update Neovim, you can specify a specific version of the plugins involved
instead of the latest stable version. How you do this will vary depending on
your plugin manager, but you can see one example using `lazy.nvim` here:
<https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter/blob/nvim-0.8.3/lua/plugins/quarto.lua>

The `version = ...` lines to look out for are for the following plugins:

>lua
    {
        'quarto-dev/quarto-nvim',
        'jmbuhr/otter.nvim',
        'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter'
    }
<


USAGE                                               *quarto-quarto-nvim-usage*


CONFIGURE ~

You can pass a lua table with options to the setup function as shown in
quarto-nvim-kickstarter/..quarto.lua
<https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter/blob/main/lua/plugins/quarto.lua>

It will be merged with the default options, which are shown below in the
example. If you want to use the defaults, simply call `setup` without arguments
or with an empty table.

>lua
    require('quarto').setup{
      debug = false,
      closePreviewOnExit = true,
      lspFeatures = {
        enabled = true,
        chunks = "curly",
        languages = { "r", "python", "julia", "bash", "html" },
        diagnostics = {
          enabled = true,
          triggers = { "BufWritePost" },
        },
        completion = {
          enabled = true,
        },
      },
      codeRunner = {
        enabled = false,
        default_method = nil, -- 'molten' or 'slime'
        ft_runners = {}, -- filetype to runner, ie. `{ python = "molten" }`.
                         -- Takes precedence over `default_method`
        never_run = { "yaml" }, -- filetypes which are never sent to a code runner
      },
    }
<


PREVIEW ~

Use the command

>vim
    QuartoPreview
<

or access the function from lua, e.g. to create a keybinding:

>lua
    local quarto = require('quarto')
    quarto.setup()
    vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>qp', quarto.quartoPreview, { silent = true, noremap = true })
<

Then use the keyboard shortcut to open `quarto preview` for the current file or
project in the active working directory in the neovim integrated terminal in a
new tab.

Note: While you can use `QuartoPreview` without configuring the plugin via
`quarto.setup`, other features strictly require it.


LANGUAGE SUPPORT                         *quarto-quarto-nvim-language-support*

`quarto-nvim` automatically activates `otter.nvim` for quarto files if language
features are enabled.


DEMO ~

USAGE ~

Uou can open the hover documentation for R, python and julia code chunks with
`K`, got-to-definition with `gd` etc. and get autocompletion via the lsp source
for your completion plugin.

A list of currently available language server requests can be found in the
otter.nvim documentation
<https://github.com/jmbuhr/otter.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#lsp-methods-currently-implemented>.


R DIAGNOSTICS CONFIGURATION ~

To make diagnostics work with R you have to configure the linter a bit, since
the language buffers in the background separate code with blank links, which we
want to ignore. Otherwise you get a lot more diagnostics than you probably
want. Add file `.lintr` to your home folder and fill it with:

>
    linters: linters_with_defaults(
        trailing_blank_lines_linter = NULL,
        trailing_whitespace_linter = NULL
      )
<

You can now also enable other lsp features, such as the show hover function and
shortcut, independent of showing diagnostics by enabling lsp features but not
enabling diagnostics.


OTHER EDGE CASES ~

Other languages might have similar issues (e.g. I see a lot of warnings about
whitespace when activating diagnostics with `lua`). If you come across them and
have a fix, I will be very happy about a pull request! Or, what might
ultimately be the cleaner way of documenting language specific issues, an entry
in the wiki <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-nvim/wiki>.


RUNNING CODE                                 *quarto-quarto-nvim-running-code*

Quarto-nvim doesn’t run code for you, instead, it will interface with
existing code running plugins and tell them what to run. There are currently
two such code running plugins that quarto will work with: 1. molten-nvim
<https://github.com/benlubas/molten-nvim> - a code runner that supports the
jupyter kernel, renders output below each code cell, and optionally renders
images in the terminal. 2. vim-slime <https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime> -
a general purpose code runner with support for sending code to integrated nvim
terminals, tmux panes, and many others.

I recommend picking a code runner, setting it up based on its README, and then
coming back to this point to learn how Quarto will augment that code runner.

This plugin enables easily sending code cells to your code runner. There are
two different ways to do this: commands, covered below; and lua functions,
covered right here. _By default these functions will only run cells that are
the same language as the current cell._

Quarto exposes code running functions through to runner module:
`require('quarto.runner')`. Those functions are: - `run_cell()` - runs the
current cell - `run_above(multi_lang)` - runs all the cells above the current
one, **and** the current one, in order - `run_below(multi_lang)` - runs all the
cells below the current one, **and** the current one, in order -
`run_all(multi_lang)` - runs all the cells in the document -
`run_line(multi_lang)` - runs the line of code at your cursor - `run_range()` -
run code inside the visual range

Each function that takes the optional `multi_lang` argument will run cells of
all languages when called with the value `true`, and will only run cells that
match the language of the current cell otherwise. As a result, just calling
`run_all()` will run all cells that match the language of the current cell.

Here are some example run mappings:

>lua
    local runner = require("quarto.runner")
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<localleader>rc", runner.run_cell,  { desc = "run cell", silent = true })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<localleader>ra", runner.run_above, { desc = "run cell and above", silent = true })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<localleader>rA", runner.run_all,   { desc = "run all cells", silent = true })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<localleader>rl", runner.run_line,  { desc = "run line", silent = true })
    vim.keymap.set("v", "<localleader>r",  runner.run_range, { desc = "run visual range", silent = true })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<localleader>RA", function()
      runner.run_all(true)
    end, { desc = "run all cells of all languages", silent = true })

RECOMMENDED PLUGINS                   *quarto-quarto-nvim-recommended-plugins*

Quarto works great with a number of plugins in the neovim ecosystem. You can

python here:
