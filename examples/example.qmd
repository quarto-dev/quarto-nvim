# Hello World

This is some python code, in which we define a function `hello`:

```{python} 
def hello():
  print("Hello")
```

This is how we call it:

```{python} 
hello()
```

```{haskell}
xs = [x | x <- [1..10]]
```

We can press `gd` to go to its definition.

Let's demonstrate the autompletion:

```{python} 
import numpy as np
```

And code hovers with `K`.

# Furthermore

And then we can work on integrating this for multiple 
languages in the same document, like this R function:

```{r} 
hello_from_r <- function() {
  print("hello")
}
```

Unsurprisingly, the function does the same thing:

```{r} 
hello_from_r()
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
