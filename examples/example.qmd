# Hello World

This is some python code,
in which we define a function `hello`:
  
```{python} 
def hello():
  print("Hello")
```

```{python} 
import numpy as np
np.ze
```

This is how we call it:

```{python} 
hello()
```

And this function is not found because we have a typo:

```{python} 
helo()
```

Now, we use the function in the next code chunk
to highlight the necessity of having all code
chunks in the same hidden document for the language server:

Let's make this work!

# Furthermore

And then we can work on integrating this for multiple 
languages in the same document, like this R function:

```{r} 
hello_from_r <- function() {
    print("hello")
}
```

Unsurprisingly, the function does the same thing:

```{r} 
hello_from_r()
```
